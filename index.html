								<p>NEWBachelor of Computer Science with a Conecentration in Software Engineering as of June 2021. I have an 
									emphasis on web development and iOS Application Development due to developing a few Python/Django personal 
									portfolios, websites for friends, and a couple of iOS Applications, but no matter what I value my general skill
									as a Software Engineer above all else. Attending Southern New Hampshire University to obtain my Bachelor's 
									was one of the best decisions I have ever made. My entire 4 years here has been a positive experience and it is 
									honestly kind of sad graduating, yet as life goes on I can't help but to feel excited about pursuing my career dreams 
									in Software Engineering.
								</p>
								<h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
								<p>The course work at Southern New Hampshire University is phenominal, it is aimed to keep you motivated
									and thinking in different perspectives which really enticed me to learn through out the entire degree.
									Southern New Hampshire University has been and is still currently the number 1 top online school for 
									Computer Science degrees, not only am I proud to attend such a prestigious school but it also gives
									me peace of mind as the course work is proven to be good.
								</p>
								<p>This Capstone Course (CS-499) not only tied together most of what I learned but also gave me more
									confidence to be able to completely develop applications and communicate with other professionals.
									Even the projects I am going to be displaying here are only a fraction of the vast knowledge I gained 
									through this program, my only hopes are that my constant efforts and updates on this portfolio proves my 
									skills and professional status to other professionals and employers alike.
								</p>
								<h3>Collaborating in a Team Environment</h3>
								<p>Collaboration especially in a team environment is something I have been anxious about since the beginning
									of this program and I can honestly say that Southern New Hampshire's efforts to ease that anxiety
									have been amazing. After taking both CS-250 Software Development Life Cycle, and CS-310 Collaboration and 
									Team Project I have lost most of my anxiety completly. Both of these course have taught me how to work with 
									others through different applications such as GitHub and BitBucket, and has also taught me about the agile 
									Methodology in the SDLC. After understanding both of these concepts working with a team becomes a lot more 
									efficient and beneficial to my career plans, instead of anxious and stressful.
								</p>
								<h3>Communicating to Stakeholders</h3>
								<p>Communication to me is one of the biggest the most important professional abilities to have regardless of 
									if it is with your team, clients, or stakeholders. Specifically communication to stakeholders holds high importance
									as they would be the biggest decision makers around making them technically the boss or the client. Communication 
									goes a long way and being clear about all requirements and communicating through out sections of the work could 
									potentially even save a lot of money and time. I recall IT-201 Computer Platform technologies had me writing up 
									proposals for clients with an emphasis on efficieny and cost effectiveness. Skills such as these will provide me 
									with the ability to work self-employed or provide more knowledge towards higher level ends of a company towards my
									future career plans.
								</p>
								<h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
								<p>Almost every programmer knows that Data Structures and Algorithms are basically the building blocks of developing. 
									CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms gave me a deeper understanding of structures and algorithms themselves and 
									developing them in C++ was difficult but really helpful to my understanding of computer science. Data structures 
									organize and hold data efficiently, while algorithms boil down to how the data is used whether it is passed through 
									methods, loops, just about anything. Having this understanding provides me with the ability to create clean, concise, 
									error-free code.
								</p>
								<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
								<p>I have always thought of Software Engineering as a pretty broad topic especially for having a concentration on a degree, 
									but after recently taking CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering my thoughts have changed completly. After the completion of 
									that course I realized that Software Engineering really is the ability to take any kind of code and use it in a way that is 
									beneficial to me, whether that is taking code and reverse engineering it altogether or just updating for the better. IT-145 
									Foundation in Application Development's final project was to build a zooMonitoring Java application in Eclipse, I have taken 
									this project and reverse engineered it to be the iOS application you can see in my projects tab.
								</p>
								<h3>Database</h3>
								<p>Databases started off really confusing to me when they appeared to me in class, but SNHU fixed my confusion really quick after 
									I took DAD-220 Introduction to SQL, this course taught me how to create CRUD operations in SQL and use them through out the 
									Codio environment securly. Since taking that class I have built PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB databases and without 
									the understanding of SQL language I wouldn't even have been close to finishing my PostgreSQL database for my early personal 
									portfolio. DAT-220 Fundamentals of Data Mining helped me to appreciate big databases and how to navigate through them efficiently 
									and safely through the use of different tools and methods to visualize data.
								</p>
								<h3>Security</h3>
								<p>Security clearly is something that can't be spoken about enough, there never is and never will be enough security, there will 
									always be someone that can hack through the newest security measures which just shows the importance of keeping updated with 
									the best security practices available. CS-405 Secure Coding really helped deepen my understanding as to why security is so 
									important, and some of the best practices to continue being secure, practices such as adhering to the principal of least 
									privledge, which means making sure user interaction can only do so much to the code, limit the ability of a malicious user 
									to be able to write a script that can access your codebase. Southern New Hampshire University provides a high level understanding 
									of security in computer science with the tips, tricks, and best practices constantly being talked about.
								</p>
								<h3>Tieing Together</h3>
								<p>The artifacts I have chosen to present in my ePortfolio include aspects of Software Design and Engineering, Data Structures and 
									Algorithms, and Databases. Both of these artifacts together help to showcase my skills as a full developer ready to build out 
									iOS applications or websites for client satisfaction.
								</p>
								<p>My first artifact the zooMonitoring iOS application was first developed as a Java application that barley even worked, after 
									reverse engineering this application for iOS devices not only have I got it working really well but it also has an interace 
									instead of just a command line. the entire point of this application is to be able to find out information on either animals 
									or habitats depending on which species you're looking for information on. After getting to the next page there are buttons to 
									press and find out information on the animals, this application shows off my Software Engineering skills with reverse engineering 
									and also showcases my Data Structures and Algorithms skills by showing off the added complexity of more species and more functionality.
								</p>
								<p>My final artifact the xboxGamesDB MongoDB/React/Node.js Command line interface was created based off of the CRUD SQL statements in 
									DAD-220 Intro to SQL's final. MongoDB itself is a really popular database so I figured this artifact would be perfect to showcase 
									any of the skills I posses in database languages. The point of this application is to be able to load it up on the command line and 
									log into the cloud atlas MongoDB cluster that is holding the database. After logging in as a user you have the ability to run all 
									CRUD functionality just through a series of asked questions. Southern New Hampshire University has taught me so much through the last 
									four years and I am happy I can share some of that knowledge with who is reading!
