										finals taken from other courses to turning into beautiful applications that could serve real purpose.</p>

										<h3>Twitter Script<br/>
										Python Data Analysis</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/twitter_Script.jpg" width="425" height="400" alt="" />
									<p>I wrote this Python Data Analysis twitter script to count the total amount of tweets from a specific hashtag from a list of users
										while also pulling each one of those tweets and storing them in a .json file. This .json file can be parsed/formatted and stored within Pandas
										for easy analysis with graphs/etc. I was commissioned with this assignment by an NFT project to promote members to tweet for the said project,
										this would allow for constant tracking with ease, expectation of rank and potential gain in investments/collections. My plan is to host this script on 
										a website to keep my intellectual property secure and implement a database of all the members for simple additions and removal of members. This website 
										will also have an easy way for the admins of the project to log in, click a button to get the daily totals for analysis.

										<h3>Open When...<br/>
										iOS Application</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/open_When_App.jpg" width="250" height="400" alt="" />
									<p>I am currently in constant development of this iOS application; I consider it my hobby I really enjoy doing in my spare time and I think it is an amazing idea.
										The project is about an Open When Letter application that can be used by loved ones around the world, the idea is to have accounts for each user and each 
										one of these users can add friends/family on their accounts, after the friend request is accepted either party can now send a letter to the other. 
										The letters themselves are going to be time locked based on the sender's time allotment and when it comes that time the letter can be opened and read by the 
										recipient, I am hosting a firebase database to hold each account with their respective letters and even have the potential of putting extra items inside 
										each letter, for example a bit of money from a grandparent. Another good example would be Military members sending time opened letters for when they 
										get out of bootcamp. I would say I am working out the front-end of the application currently with firebase already set up, I just need 
										to work out the kinks in the front-end and then finish development up in the back-end and it will be ready to send to the Apple Developers!

										<h3>ZooMonitor<br/>
										iOS Application</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/iOSapp.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="" />
									<p>This application was reverse engineered from the zooMonitoring.java application that didn't work, to a nice looking responsive iOS 
										application. This inclusion comes with my intention of working with iOS applications in the future and with further updates I plan
										on using this example to help me showcase my skill set in developing applications, reverse engineering applications,
										designing applications, and increasing complexity within applications.

										<h3>XboxGamesDB<br/>
										MongoDB/Realm/Node.Js Interface</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/xboxGamesDB.jpg" width="450" height="400" alt="" />
									<p>I have created a MongoDB/Realm/Node.js command line interface that holds the xbox games located on my internal hard
										drive. This cross platform interface makes it easy to run CRUD functionality just by answering questions, account creation
										for realm available as well. This database project is included to showcase my skills not only with databases in general, but 
										also with MongoDB, Realm, and Node.js.
