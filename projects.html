									<h3>Code Review</h3>
									<p>My Code Review provides an explanation of the beginning of the two applications beneath it, how they started from just being
										finals taken from other courses to turning into beautiful applications that could serve real purpose.</p>

										<h3>Polygon NFT<br/>
										OpenSea NFT Collection</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/polygonNFT.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="" />
									<p>For this Blockchain project I wrote a Smart Contract on Remix with OpenZeppelin and deployed it with Moralis hosting to OpenSea. First I 
										did this through the testnet section of OpenSea with Ethereum, after making sure all was set up I launched it on Polygon through OpenSea on 
										the mainnet to give the NFT's the ability to be bought and sold. I only had 4 NFT's altogether but it was a successful launch and I transferred 
										one of them to a buddy. This process ended up only costing me 0.17$ cents to get them on my profile and 0.04$ cents to transfer the NFT itself.

										<h3>Twitter Script<br/>
										Python Data Analysis</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/twitter_Script.jpg" width="475" height="400" alt="" />
									<p>I wrote this Python Data Analysis twitter script to count the total amount of tweets from a specific hashtag from a list of users
										while pulling each one of those tweets and storing them in a .json file. The .json file can be parsed/formatted and stored within Pandas
										for easy analysis with graphs/etc. I was commissioned with this assignment by an NFT project to promote members to tweet for the project,
										this would allow for constant tracking with ease, expectation of rank and potential gain in investments/collections. My plan is to host this script on 
										a website to keep my intellectual property secure and implement a database of all the members for simple addition/removal of members. This website 
										will also have a way for the admins of the project to log in and click a button to get the daily totals for analysis.

										<h3>Open When...<br/>
										iOS Application</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/open_When_App.jpg" width="250" height="400" alt="" />
									<p>I am currently in development of this iOS application; I consider it my hobby I really enjoy doing in my spare time and I think it has an amazing concept.
										The project is an Open When Letter application that can be used by loved ones around the world, each user has an account and each 
										one of these users can add others. After the request is accepted either party can now send a letter to the other. The letters themselves 
										are time locked based on the sender's time allotment and when it reaches that time the letter can be opened and read by the recipient. 
										Hosted by a firebase database to hold each account and letters, it even has potential to put extra items inside each letter, 
										for example a bit of money from a grandparent. I am working out the front-end currently with firebase already set up, I just need 
										to work out the design in the front-end and then finish development in the back-end and it will be shipped to the Apple Developers!

										<h3>ZooMonitor<br/>
										iOS Application</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/iOSapp.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="" />
									<p>This application was reverse engineered from the zooMonitoring.java application that didn't work, to a nice looking responsive iOS 
										application. This inclusion comes with my intention of working with iOS applications in the future and with further updates I plan
										on using this example to help me showcase my skill set in developing applications, reverse engineering applications,
										designing applications, and increasing complexity within applications.

										<h3>XboxGamesDB<br/>
										MongoDB/Realm/Node.Js Interface</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/xboxGamesDB.jpg" width="450" height="400" alt="" />
									<p>I have created a MongoDB/Realm/Node.js command line interface that holds the xbox games located on my internal hard
										drive. This cross platform interface makes it easy to run CRUD functionality just by answering questions, account creation
										for realm available as well. This database project is included to showcase my skills not only with databases in general, but 
										also with MongoDB, Realm, and Node.js.
